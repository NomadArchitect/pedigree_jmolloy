BUILD README
=======================

We highly recommend you first try one of our Easy Build scripts before you try
and run SCons manually. There's a little bit of work involved in setting up a
build of Pedigree for the first time - after that it's as easy as just running
"scons" at the command line.

Just run ./easy_build_x86.sh, ./easy_build_x64.sh, or ./easy_build_arm.sh to
build Pedigree for the relevant architecture. Dependencies and a cross-compiler
will be installed/created, allowing you to jump straight into testing Pedigree.

To build Pedigree at any point after this, just run "scons".

To switch between architectures, just remove "options.cache" before you re-run
an easy build script.

Alternatively, you can build manually if you already have a cross-compiler:

Required: SCons 1.2.0

Simply run:

scons CROSS=/path/to/compilers/bin/i686-pedigree-

You should give SCons the path to gcc in CROSS, ending in '-' so it can add
'gcc', 'g++' or 'as' to the end of the stub and get a valid compiler. It'll
work out from the compiler chosen what default options and what architecture
to compile.

Run "scons -h" to obtain a full set of arguments you can pass to configure
the build.

NOTE: This must be a full path. It cannot contain bash expansions such as
environment variables or '~'.

IMAGES DIRECTORY
=======================

Note: this information is out of date.

The images/local directory allows you to use Pacman, Pedigree's package manager,
to manage your hard disk image file set. To do so you will need a version of
Pacman on your host (visit the Arch Linux website to find source packages).

To manage the images/local directory you need to have the following in your
pacman.conf (usually in /etc):

RootDir     = /path/to/pedigree/root/images/local/
DBPath      = /path/to/pedigree/root/images/local/support/pacman/db
CacheDir    = /path/to/pedigree/root/images/local/support/pacman/cache
LogFile     = /path/to/pedigree/root/images/local/support/pacman/log/pacman.log
HoldPkg     = pacman pedigree-core pedigree-tui
SyncFirst   = pacman pedigree-core pedigree-tui

[pedigree-main]
Server = http://www.theiselins.net/pedigree/pacman

If all goes well, running "pacman -Sy" should synchronise the local working
copy with the remote database and you'll be able to run "pacman -S <package>".
