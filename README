BUILD README
=======================

Required: SCons 1.2.0

Simply run:

scons CROSS=/path/to/compilers/bin/i686-elf-

You should give SCons the path to gcc in CROSS, ending in '-' so it can add
'gcc', 'g++' or 'as' to the end of the stub and get a valid compiler. It'll
work out from the compiler chosen what default options and what architecture
to compile.

Run "scons -h" to obtain a full set of arguments you can pass to configure
the build.

NOTE: This must be a full path. It cannot contain bash expansions such as
environment variables or '~'.
